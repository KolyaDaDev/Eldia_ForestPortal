# Eldia Forest Entrance

### The move over from my other repo except this is built with OOP

### If there is a more efficient way of doing this please let me know. Didn't wanna fuck up the other code base.

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
